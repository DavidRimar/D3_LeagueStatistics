# D3 League Statistics App

- This project uses the **D3 JS** library version 4 to render fictional league statistics in the form of stacked barcharts.

- The application is completely responsive on all window-sizes thanks to **Bootsrap 4**.

- The charts are easily customizable and built with ease of re-usability in mind.

- The development proccess mocks an MVP architectural pattern, with **TypeScript** used to safeguard against errors.

- **ESlint, Prettier, husky** and **lint-staged** are used as the main dev dependencies.

- On the server side, the app uses **Node JS + Express JS** to serve the page.

- The app is deployed staticly via **Heroku**: (https://d3-league-statistics.herokuapp.com/).
