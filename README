This project uses D3 v4 to render fictional league statistics in the form of stacked barcharts.

The application is completely responsive on all window-sizes thanks to Bootsrap 4.

The charts are easily customizable and built with ease of re-usability in mind.

The development proccess mocks an MVP architectural pattern, with TypeScript used to safeguard against errors.

ESlint, Prettier, husky and lint-staged are used as the main dev dependencies.

On back-end side, the app uses Node JS + Express JS to serve the page.
